# Tradier client with the Fluent approach

The library is build to use Tradier APIs through C# managed code <https://tradier.com/>. A wrapper of Web Apis <https://developer.tradier.com/documentation>. This library would allow making calls in a much easier manner.

Please feel free to extend as per your need basis.

The API is build based on a Fluent approach using the Builder pattern. The Unit tests are just depicting how to utilize the library. The pattern itself would guide how to compose/create Tradier request. So, basically no need for any documentation.

Please note that only **Market Data** API is covered as of now.

To test the application you can get Developer Access key from here: <https://developer.tradier.com/>
